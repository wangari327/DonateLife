    <string name="transplantation">Organ transplantation is often the only treatment for end state organ failure,
        such as liver and heart failure.
        Although end stage renal disease patients can be treated through other renal replacement therapies,
        kidney transplantation is generally accepted as the best treatment both for quality of life and cost effectiveness.
        Kidney transplantation is by far the most frequently carried out transplantation globally.</string>
    <string name="law">The law allows Kenyans, either in a written will or oral statement before witnesses,
        to donate their bodies or body parts to persons or institutions of their choice upon death.
        Ephantus Maina of the Happy Kidney (HAKI) Foundation
        explains that donations to institutions would ideally be preserved in an organ bank for use in competent transplant facilities.
        The challenge now, Maina says, is to have a significant mass of Kenyans volunteering to donate organs or their bodies after death.
        The more the better but before then the country would need to build the capacity to effectively collect, screen and preserve the donations.
        Of course with a strong mechanism to keep charlatans away,he says.
        For example, to make sure doctors do not coerce patients into untimely removal of organs,
        a doctor who authorises such a procedure will not play a leading role in its transplantation to the other party.</string>
    <string name="life_saver">Over 100,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for an organ transplant.
        Unfortunately, many may never get the call saying that a suitable donor organ and a second chance at life has been found.
        It is estimated that every day in the U.S. 20 patients die because of the lack of donor organs.

        It can be hard to think about what iss going to happen to your body after you die, let alone donating your organs and tissue.
        But being an organ donor is a generous and worthwhile decision that can be a lifesaver.</string>
    <string name="living">Making just a few changes in your lifestyle can help you live longer.
        A recent study found that four bad behaviors, smoking,
        drinking too much alcohol, not exercising, and not eating enough fruits and veggies can hustle you into an early grave,
        and, in effect, age you by as many as 12 years.
        Fortunately, you can do something to correct these and other unhealthy behaviors.
        Adopt the following nine habits to keep your body looking and feeling young.</string>
